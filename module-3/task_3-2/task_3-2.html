      <li>In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?</li>
      <p>
        Yes, it is possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop 
      </p>
      <li>In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop? Describe what would or would not be necessary to achieve this. Provide a thorough explanation of your answer.</li>
      <p>
        Yes we can create a "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop. It continues until we set it to break, or until it crashes.
      </p>
      <li>Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can the program perform other tasks concurrently?</li>
      <p>
        A computer can compute this very quickly, as it can make thousands or even millions of guesses in a matter of seconds. While the program is guessing, it is typically focused on that task and may not be able to perform other tasks concurrently unless it is designed to do so using multithreading or asynchronous programming techniques.
      </p>
      <li>Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance, change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not matter?</li>
      <p>
        Yes, we can change the order of rows and columns in nested "for" loops. The choice of which loop is innermost and which is outermost can affect the behavior of the loops and the way we access elements in a data structure. However, the overall logic and structure of the loops must still be maintained.
