      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
        Constants are used when you want to have a fixed value. Since it cannot be changed. 
        Meanwhile variables are used when a value needs to be updated. No, constants cannot be always be used.
        For example constants are not good for dynamic changes, it is prefered to use variables since it is being changed.
      </p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
			  Parantheses alteres the operations by overriding the order of the standard operation (PEMDAS/BODMAS).
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
			  We limit floating-point numbers to gived number of decimals by using the method “toFixed()” or “Math.round()”.
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				We compare two floating-point values by using “Epsilon”. We check if the value between 12.199999 and 12.2 with the smallest difference, and not by zero (==). We can use 0.0001 for exmple instead of 0.
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				Comparison operators returns a Boolean value (TRUE or FALSE). They check if they are TRUE or FALSE by using if-statements TRUE=block runs and FALSE=code does not run. We can also use NOT operator (!) which reverse the result of the comparison. 
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				The function works by creating random numbers between 0 and 1, but does not fully return number 1. It can be used to change range, generating random numbers/items or overall be used for upredictability and variations for programms.
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				Modulus is used to find what remains after dividing one number by another. We need this operator in mathematical operators if we want to check if a number is even or odd. 0 remainder = even and if it has remainders = odd.
